<!-- abstract: "Drift vehicle control offers valuable insights to support safe autonomous driving in extreme conditions, which hinges on tracking a particular path while maintaining the vehicle states near the drift equilibrium points (DEP). However, conventional tracking methods are not adaptable for drift vehicles due to their opposite steering angle and yaw rate. In this paper, we propose an adaptive path tracking (APT) control method to dynamically adjust drift states to follow the reference path, improving the commonly utilized predictive path tracking methods with released computation burden. Furthermore, existing control strategies necessitate a precise system model to calculate the DEP, which can be more intractable due to the highly nonlinear drift dynamics and sensitive vehicle parameters. To tackle this problem, an adaptive learning-based model predictive control (ALMPC) strategy is proposed based on the APT method, where an upper-level Bayesian optimization is employed to learn the DEP and APT control law to instruct a lower-level MPC drift controller. This hierarchical system architecture can also resolve the inherent control conflict between path tracking and drifting by separating these objectives into different layers. The ALMPC strategy is verified on the Matlab-Carsim platform, and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness in controlling the drift vehicle to follow a clothoid-based reference path even with the misidentified road friction parameter." -->
